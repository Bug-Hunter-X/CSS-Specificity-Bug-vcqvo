This repository contains a CSS code example demonstrating a common issue: unexpected behavior due to high specificity. The bug.css file shows the original code with the issue, while bugSolution.css provides a solution to resolve the problem. The issue arises from the order of CSS selectors and the use of !important, causing styles to be applied in an unexpected order and leading to unexpected visual results. The solution focuses on improving the specificity of the selectors and removing unnecessary uses of !important to restore expected behavior.
